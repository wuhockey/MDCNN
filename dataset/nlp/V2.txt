Did you get the mail? So you saw my letter?
Yeah.
It's not fair.
Yeah.  I know.
I don't understand.  You've already done so much, I don't know why do you have to go back.
I don't know.  I put in that. request too. They didn't...
I guess, you know, everybody has to make sacrifices.
I don't know, it's just not fair.  I think you've already made your sacrifice.
There's people that have given more though, you know?
I just don't see how they can make you leave when you have a new baby - we have a new kid.
I know.
Then why is that fair?  Why--
There's babies over there, though, that need mothers.
I don't know how you can be okay with this?  I don't know why you're not-- you're fine with it.

What am I going to do? Huh?
You'll videotape everything, yeah?

Don't you guys have access to computers over there.
Last month--  Yeah.
I just don't know how I'm going to do it without you.
I have to find sitters.
I can't raise a baby by myself.  How?
We've got friends, that's why we moved here, huh?  Because there is a day care down the street.
I know.
And your mother is close by.
I'll send you lots of letters.
And I want lots and lots and lots of pictures.
It's just not fair.
