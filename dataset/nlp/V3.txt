So what's up?  What's new?
Well Vegas was awesome.
Yeah.  I heard.
And, um, I got married.
Shut up.  No- in Vegas?
Yeah.  In the old town part.
Who did you marry?
Chuck. 
Did you propose to you?
Um- Yes.  It was very romantic.
It was at the slot machines.
Oh.  The Wheel of Fortune slots?
Uhuh, uhuh.  He won big and he-and he realized that the only thing that would make it better was me as his bride.
He turned to you and was like...
Hey.  Let's get married and I said okay.
That's really romantic.
Yeah.  Well.  You know, because he's leaving the next day.
Yeah.
But we're going to have a honeymoon cruise.
Does that mean that you're going to get citizenship, too, in- in England or whatever?
Oh.  I hadn't even thought about that.
Yeah.  Think about that.
He's not going to be a citizen, though.
Yeah.  But he'll have like a long visa.  Can you go visit then for a long time?
I think you can.
Oh.  Totally.
Yeah. 
Oh, how are you going to do the long distance thing?  So wait, are you going to move there?
I guess I'll-  I guess I'll have an internet husband.[LAUGHTER]
Like you need another one of those.[LAUGHTER]
I have an internet boyfriend.  I guess I'll have to juggle the two.  Is that cheating?  I don't know. Hmm.
Is that your phone?
Yeah, so [LAUGHTER] He's calling me now
He loves you.
He likes to keep tabs, you know.
How much did he win at the slot?
Uh, I think seven hundred and fifty dollars.
Really? Penny slots?
Penny slots. That's what he plays.
Wow.
Yeah.
I'm a big fan of the Wheel of Fortune quarters. But it just costs so much.  I don't know.
Oh.
Yeah.  We played Wheel of Fortune pennies.  It's like a giant thing with like-
But the pennies always get you because you end up spending like, you know, fifty bucks.
Fifty bucks. Mmhmm.
like, wait, but it's just pennies.  You're like, wait a minute I'm on to you.
Yeah.
Well so now we're married. We have cat children.
Awesome.
Cat babies.
We renamed Brenda, Lumber Janet.
She needs a new name each state that we go into. [LAUGHTER]
